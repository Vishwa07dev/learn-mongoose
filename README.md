# Using Mongoose for data modelling in Node.js with MongoDB
## _Integrating Mongodb with Node.js_

This code base contains the sample code for doing data modelling in Mongodb using Mongoose
## Features
* Create Schema
* Create the database in MongoDB programmatically
* Create the collection in MongoDB programmatically
* Putting inbuilt constraints on the model schema
* Creating custom validators for the model schema
* CRUD operations with MongoDB using Mongoose

## How is the code organized in this repo ?
The whole repo is divided into multiple branches. Each branch contains code for a specific concept. For example __part1__ has the basic setup and schema concept. Each branch is built on the top of the previous branch

## Prerequisite
- Understanding of Node.js
- Understanding of Async Await
- Mongo DB locally installed and running

## Tech
- Node.js
